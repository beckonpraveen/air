Tribune Photo Jaswant Shetra Tribune News Service Ludhiana, February 23 After keeping the district administration on its toes for five days, several farmer unions protesting near Ayali Chowk on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Highway ended their agitation today. As many as seven farmers unions were up in the arms against alleged harassment being caused by banks in the name of debt recovery. Farmer union leader Jhanda Singh Jethuke said they had decided to lift the dharna after banks assured the farmers that they would not be harassed. Protesting farmers had blocked traffic on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Highway for four-five hours for the last two days, which led to massive traffic jam. Farmers asked banks to return blank cheuqes taken by the latter while sanctioning loans. “The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed banks to return cheuqes taken from farmers as a guarantee while sanctioning loans. The court has asked banks to inform them by March 5 regarding how many cheuqes have been returned to farmers,” said Jethuke. The farmers’ union activists also asked banks to take back cases filed by them against farmers who failed to clear their debt. “We have given an ultimatum to take back police cases filed by banks against farmers by March 25. If banks do not respond, we will have no option but to hold a protest at Patiala,” said Boota Singh, a farmer  activist.
