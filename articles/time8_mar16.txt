Massive Protest Infront Of AGP Headquarters In Guwahati Opposing Alliance. Hundreds of AGP leaders and party workers belonging to several movement groups on March 16th 2019 staged a massive protest in front of the Asom Gana Parishad(AGP) headquarters at Ambari in Guwahati opposing the fresh ties between the AGP and BJP in poll-bound Assam.
Irate workers further gheraoed the AGP office and shouted slogans showing resentment against the regional party’s decision to contest the ensuing Lok Sabha polls with the incumbent BJP.
Meanwhile, as the situation turned ugly the police deployed at the area beefed up security to prevent any ruckus and detained several protesters keeping in view of the law and order situation.
“There are people from all over the state belonging to several movement groups opposing the AGP-BJP ties. The AGP had earlier cleared their grounds over the contentious Bill and snapped ties with BJP but the recent development is quite confusing,” said a North East Minority Students Union(NEMSU) member.
“The AGP leaders have betrayed the party by taking such a decision for their personal interests. They are power hungry. The same leaders who had broken their relationship with the BJP over the Citizenship Bill have now come into an alliance,” added another irked woman protester.
Two months after pulling out over the much-debated Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, the AGP and BJP are back as allies in poll-bound Assam. The deal was sealed on March 12th, 2019 in Guwahati.
The Lok Sabha elections in Assam will be held in three phases on April 11th, 18th and 23rd, 2019. The results of the election will be announced on May 23rd, 2019.
