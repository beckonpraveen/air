Mar 14, 2019, 11:37 IST More than 50 people ransacked a Tasmac bar owned by A Nagaraj , who was arrested for attacking the brother of a Pollachi sexual assault victim, at Suleeswaranpatti near Pollachi on Wednesday. Residents of Suleeswaranpatti village and nearby areas entered the bar and forced people consuming liquor to get out of the bar. They then ransacked the bar by breaking liquor bottles and damaging furniture and refrigerator. Workers at the bar closed it after the incident.  A resident of Suleeswaranpatti said, “Nagaraj has escaped by getting conditional bail in the assault case. But, he has also involved in the sex scandal. We have a video of Nagaraj sexually abusing a woman. Police is trying to help Nagaraj. He should be arrested immediately for sexual abuse.”  Meanwhile, a video of K Thirunavukkarasu, the main accused in the sex scandal case, claiming that Nagaraj was also involved in the case went viral on social media on Wednesday. Another video of Nagaraj sexually abusing a woman also went viral on social media.  Nagaraj was arrested on the charges of attacking the brother of a 19-year-old college student, a victim of the Pollachi sex scandal, on February 26. He was granted conditional bail by a court on the same day itself. Nagaraj, who was the AIADMK Jayalalithaa Peravai’s 34th ward secretary in Pollachi, was expelled from the party after the incident came to light.
