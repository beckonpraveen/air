Tribune Photo Jaswant Shetra Tribune News Service Ludhiana, February 23 After keeping the district administration on its toes for five days, several farmer unions protesting near Ayali Chowk on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Highway ended their agitation today. As many as seven farmers unions were up in the arms against alleged harassment being caused by banks in the name of debt recovery. Farmer union leader Jhanda Singh Jethuke said they had decided to lift the dharna after banks assured the farmers that they would not be harassed. Protesting farmers had blocked traffic on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Highway for four-five hours for the last two days, which led to massive traffic jam. Farmers asked banks to return blank cheuqes taken by the latter while sanctioning loans. “The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed banks to return cheuqes taken from farmers as a guarantee while sanctioning loans. The court has asked banks to inform them by March 5 regarding how many cheuqes have been returned to farmers,” said Jethuke. The farmers’ union activists also asked banks to take back cases filed by them against farmers who failed to clear their debt. “We have given an ultimatum to take back police cases filed by banks against farmers by March 25. If banks do not respond, we will have no option but to hold a protest at Patiala,” said Boota Singh, a farmer  activist.\\n']\n",

In the evening, teachers in large numbers gathered at the school and locked the main gate of the school. District Education Officer (Primary) Kanwal Kumari, Block Primary Education Officers (BPEOs) and other officials came to the school to avoid confrontation after the Adhyapak Sangarsh Committee announced to gherao the DEO office near the Head Post Office. Teachers also staged a sit-in at the school after they came to know their (education officials) plan. The flashpoint of confrontation is said to be the transfer of the six union leaders who boycotted the post test under the ‘Parho Punjab, Paraho Punjab’ programme initiated by Education Secretary Krishan Kumar during the last academic session. Following the protest, DSPYogesh Kumar visited the spot. Meanwhile, Kanwal said, “The transfers have been done for stopping the officials from conducting the post test.” The six teachers, who have been transferred, are Jaswinder Singh, Manoj Kumar, Gurpreet Guri, Didar Singh, Jaswinder Singh and Sukhpal Singh. Addressing the teachers during the protest, Hardeep Toderpur, a leader of the Adhyapak Sangarsh Committee, said, “Every time, on the eve of our meeting with Chief Minister, Krishan Kumar transfers leaders to scuttle the dialogue.”  Teacher slapped Gurpreet Guri, a protesting teacher, was reportedly slapped by a cluster master trainer after an argument with him during a visit to Government Elementary School, Lochma village, Ghannaur block of the district. The teacher has already filed a complaint against the cluster master trainer. Meanwhile, Gurpreet Guri said, “Cluster master trainer Raghuveer slapped me at the behest of BPEO Gurdeep Singh.

The incident was a fallout of an old dispute between the victim and the accused persons,\" police said.  On Friday, at 6.08pm, officials were informed about an incident of firing at Shukar Bazar road , they said.  On reaching the spot, it was found that the injured was shifted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital where he died during the course of treatment, a senior police officer said.  Imran suffered three gun shot injuries, he said.  Witness told police that Imran was shot by two young persons and one of them was Sumit, who had enmity with the victim, the officer said.  Investigations revealed that in 2013, Imran had attacked a relative of the accused Sumit. The two parties were also fighting a court case in connection with the incident, he said.  The five-year court battle came to an end in September 2018 when Imran was acquitted by the district court concerned, the officer added.
